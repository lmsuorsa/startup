> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you love crossword puzzles? Do you love races and competitions? Well then you'll love my website! Once a day, all users will receive the same crossword puzzle for them to complete. As they solve it, they will also be able to see the progress (in percentage) of other users who started at the same time. On top of that, they will be able to see the leaderboards for the fastest solvers of the day! With the pressure on, will you be able to win?

### Design

- **React** - Provides login, crossword, leaderboard, backend endpoint calls.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for
    - retrieving times from finished puzzles
    - retrieving percentage from other users doing the puzzle
    - crossword puzzles from third party database
    - Register, login, and logout users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't play unless you create an account.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, user stats, and leaderboards in database.
- **WebSocket** - As users complete the puzzle of the day, their percentage complete will be shown to other users completing the puzzle. When they finish, their times will appear in the leaderboards.
